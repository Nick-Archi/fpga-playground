## Overview 
Exploring FPGA development with a Terasic De1-SoC<br>

## Progress

- [x] N input switch 
- [x] 7 Segment Display controller
- [] 1 Bit ALU
- [] Simple 4 bit adder synthesized on FPGA

## Setup

- [] De1-SoC as FPGA for synthesized logic<br>
- [] ModelSim 10.5b to test my RTL units.<br>
